# Prediction of the next sunspots peak using Linear regression 

## The polar precursor method:
The polar precursor method is widely considered to be the most robust physically motivated method to predict the amplitude of an upcoming solar cycle. It uses indicators of the magnetic field concentrated near the poles around the sunspot minimum.

## Solar Cycle
The sun goes through an 11 year cycle where after at the peak of every amplitude there is a rise in solar activity. There is a correlation between the number of sunspots and increase in activity. This project tries to predict the next (25th) peak in the number of sunspots using previous data(1749-2024) of 24 peaks using linear regression.
